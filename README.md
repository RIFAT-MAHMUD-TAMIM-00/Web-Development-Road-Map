# Web-Development-Road-Map
In this repository, I upload my day-to-day learnings from my Web Development course. This is Day 1, where I learned the basics of HTML, including structure, text formatting, lists, links, images, and forms. The task file project1.html shows my practice. I will update this repo regularly as I continue my learning journey 🚀
