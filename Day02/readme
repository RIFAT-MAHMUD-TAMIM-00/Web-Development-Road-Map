Today I started learning Basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as part of Module 2 of my Portfolio Milestone. In this module, I learned how to apply styles to HTML elements from a beginner’s perspective. I explored how to add CSS using the style tag and how to link an external CSS file to an HTML document. I practiced styling different HTML elements by changing text colors, font family, font size, and using various CSS units while setting width and height. I also learned about basic CSS selectors such as tag, class, and ID selectors and how they are used to apply styles. This module introduced important layout concepts including margin, padding, border, border-radius, and the CSS box model. In addition, I learned text alignment and display properties such as inline, block, and inline-block. This is just the beginning of CSS, and in the upcoming modules I will learn more advanced topics like CSS3 features, animations, Flexbox, Grid, and additional HTML concepts. I will continue practicing by building small projects and improving my skills step by step. Happy web development!
